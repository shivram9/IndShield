**Key Features:**

* **Motion Amplification:** Identifies subtle equipment movements often invisible to the naked eye, enabling proactive maintenance and preventing unexpected breakdowns.
* **Emergency Alert System:** Allows individuals to signal for help by making a specific gesture (L pose) in front of a camera, ensuring prompt assistance in emergency situations.
* **Restricted Zone Enforcement:** Utilizes live CCTV feeds and object detection to identify unauthorized access to restricted areas, facilitating timely intervention and enforcing safety protocols.
* **Fire and Safety Gear Detection:** Employs machine learning algorithms to identify safety gear worn by personnel and detect potential fire risks in real-time, upholding the highest standards of safety and compliance.

**Benefits:**

* **Early detection of potential issues** minimizes downtime and prevents costly emergency repairs.
* **Enhanced maintenance** allows for targeted repairs and optimization of equipment performance.
* **Reduced risk of accidents and injuries** by ensuring adherence to safety protocols.
* **Improved response times** to emergencies through the use of the alert system.

## File Structure

* **`_pycache_`:** This folder is automatically generated by Python and stores compiled bytecode for faster program execution. You don't need to modify its contents.¬†
* **`app.py`:**¬†This is the core Python script containing the application logic. It defines routes, handles user interactions, and interacts with other components.
* **`instance`:** This folder is typically used for storing runtime data or configuration specific to a particular instance of the application.¬†
* **`models`:** This folder contains yolov8 models for detection.
* **`requirements.txt`:** This text file lists the external Python libraries required for the application to run. Dependencies like Flask, SQLAlchemy, OpenCV, and YOLOv8 are likely specified here.¬†
* **`static`:** This folder stores static assets used by the application, such as images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript code. These files are typically served directly by the web server without involving server-side processing.
* **`templates`:** This folder contains HTML templates used to dynamically generate web pages. The application likely uses a templating engine like Jinja2 to render these templates with data retrieved from the database or user input.

## Working

* **Backend:** Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python, is likely used to handle user requests, interact with the database, and manage application logic.
* **Database:** SQLAlchemy, an object-relational mapper (ORM), simplifies interaction with the database by providing an object-oriented interface.
* **Machine Learning:** YOLOv8, a real-time object detection model, is likely employed for features like restricted zone enforcement, fire detection, and potentially gear detection.
* **MediaPipe:** This open-source framework might be used for pose estimation in the emergency alert system.
* **OpenCV:** This open-source computer vision library is likely used for image and video processing tasks like frame capturing, object detection bounding boxes, and motion amplification.

Running the application typically involves:

## 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SurajSanap/IndShield.git
cd IndShield
```

---

## 2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

---

## 3. **Install Dependencies**

The project uses Flask, OpenCV, SQLAlchemy, Twilio, etc. Install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If you are getting error with any dependancy then just remove it's version from requirements.txt (ex. pandas == 1.22.3 -> pandas) and rerun above 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
---

## 4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the project root with values for:

```env
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBER=+0987654321
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_key
```
> No need to add Twilio config, it's not yet implemented.
---

## 5. **Prepare Database**

The app uses SQLite for:

* `user.db`
* `complaint.db`
* `cams.db`
* `alerts.db`

Run migrations:

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade
```

---

## 6. **Run the App**

```bash
python app.py
```

### Connecting a Camera via IP Address

You can use the **[IP Webcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en_IN)** app to connect your camera to the application. Follow these steps:

1. **Install the App**
   Download and install the **IP Webcam** app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en_IN).

2. **Configure the Camera**

   * Open the app and adjust your desired settings (resolution, quality, etc.).
   * Start the server within the app. The app will display an **IP address** (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8080`).

3. **Connect via the Application**

   * Open your application.
   * Enter the displayed IP address and port from the app into the camera connection field.
   * Click **Connect** to start streaming.

4. **Verify the Connection**

   * You should now see the live feed from your camera within the application.
