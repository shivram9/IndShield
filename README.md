**Key Features:**

* **Motion Amplification:** Identifies subtle equipment movements often invisible to the naked eye, enabling proactive maintenance and preventing unexpected breakdowns.
* **Emergency Alert System:** Allows individuals to signal for help by making a specific gesture (L pose) in front of a camera, ensuring prompt assistance in emergency situations.
* **Restricted Zone Enforcement:** Utilizes live CCTV feeds and object detection to identify unauthorized access to restricted areas, facilitating timely intervention and enforcing safety protocols.
* **Fire and Safety Gear Detection:** Employs machine learning algorithms to identify safety gear worn by personnel and detect potential fire risks in real-time, upholding the highest standards of safety and compliance.

**Benefits:**

* **Early detection of potential issues** minimizes downtime and prevents costly emergency repairs.
* **Enhanced maintenance** allows for targeted repairs and optimization of equipment performance.
* **Reduced risk of accidents and injuries** by ensuring adherence to safety protocols.
* **Improved response times** to emergencies through the use of the alert system.

## File Structure

* **`_pycache_`:** This folder is automatically generated by Python and stores compiled bytecode for faster program execution. You don't need to modify its contents.¬†
* **`app.py`:**¬†This is the core Python script containing the application logic. It defines routes, handles user interactions, and interacts with other components.
* **`instance`:** This folder is typically used for storing runtime data or configuration specific to a particular instance of the application.¬†
* **`models`:** This folder contains yolov8 models for detection.
* **`requirements.txt`:** This text file lists the external Python libraries required for the application to run. Dependencies like Flask, SQLAlchemy, OpenCV, and YOLOv8 are likely specified here.¬†
* **`static`:** This folder stores static assets used by the application, such as images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript code. These files are typically served directly by the web server without involving server-side processing.
* **`templates`:** This folder contains HTML templates used to dynamically generate web pages. The application likely uses a templating engine like Jinja2 to render these templates with data retrieved from the database or user input.

## Working

* **Backend:** Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python, is likely used to handle user requests, interact with the database, and manage application logic.
* **Database:** SQLAlchemy, an object-relational mapper (ORM), simplifies interaction with the database by providing an object-oriented interface.
* **Machine Learning:** YOLOv8, a real-time object detection model, is likely employed for features like restricted zone enforcement, fire detection, and potentially gear detection.
* **MediaPipe:** This open-source framework might be used for pose estimation in the emergency alert system.
* **OpenCV:** This open-source computer vision library is likely used for image and video processing tasks like frame capturing, object detection bounding boxes, and motion amplification.

Running the application typically involves:
python  -m venv .env
.env/Scripts/activate
1. Installing required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Setting up the database (likely SQLite in this case) and creating the necessary tables as defined by the models.
3. Running the application using `python app.py`.

Once running, users can access the web interface and leverage the provided functionalities to enhance industrial safety.
